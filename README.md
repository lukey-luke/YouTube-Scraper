# YouTube Scraper
- This project basically just served as a reason try out BeautifulSoup and use Flask a little bit.
- It turns out that it is very easy to get a specific element by using BeautifulSoup's find() method.
- If you actually wanted to get this data, [YouTube's API supports it](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels#statistics.commentCount "YouTube's API supports it")
- Just ran a recurring function to check those for the Youtube rivals and throw that in a chart. EZ PZ
