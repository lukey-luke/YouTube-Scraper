# YouTube Scraper
- This project basically just served as a reason try out BeautifulSoup and use Flask a little bit.
- It turns out that it is very easy to get a specific element by using BeautifulSoup's find() method.
- Just ran a recurring function to check those for the Youtube rivals and throw that in a chart. EZ PZ
